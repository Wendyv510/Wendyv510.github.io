					 At 34 years old, realizing the career choice you chose at 18 isn't working out anymore, is daunting.  The thoughts of: this is what I went to school for, got a degree in,  it's what I've been doing for 14 years now, how do I change and do something completely different now?!? It's a big leap to completely change careers, that unfortunately many people don't take because they do feel stuck, and just stay, unfullfilled, burnout for the next 30+ years.  I'm choosing to take the leap, and go from Preschool Teacher/Daycare provider to Software Engineer. 
           In choosing my next career and looking through all the options, it was difficult.  Some looked like something that I would like to do, but job field openings are scarce.  Or going back to school would be a long journey, and running my own business, working 52+ hours a week, having two children of my own and a household to run, AND go back to school for several years, is not feasible.  Then I came across Software Engineering Bootcamps!! The field seems intriguing and something I would enjoy learning and doing, the need for Software Engineers in the work field are plentiful, and the bootcamp is 10 months.  Check, check, and check!!! So, I dove in and applied, got accepted, worked hard and made it through bootcamp prep and on to the bootcamp.
             In first starting the prework, it is a lot to take in, new terminology, new sentence structures, new formats.  Flatiron does an excellent job and walking you through it though, as to make it relatable, cohesive, understandable, and functional.  It is a bootcamp, so you are learning a lot in a short amount of time.  They do a nice job of reiterating key points several times throughout the lessons though, so it's not a heard once, memorize it and move on concept.  It is also broken down to do the work as you go, and complete a lab/test before you move on.  Not just read and test, it's very hands-on, which I like and feel is better learning environment.   There is a whole class environment as well, that you can do group studies with, pair partnering, and you meet with your advisor once a week, through a Zoom platform; all face to face interacting, just not on your own.  
						   The first week in so far, all the emotions of excited, overwhelmed, happy, scared, invigorated, drained.  It's going to take a lot of hard work, but with hard work, determination, and grit, I'm confident I'll get there and be successful.  I'm so happy I took the leap and am on the journey to a new career.
